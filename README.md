# Flappy Bird
For this Android Studio Project, as a team we had the idea of ​​recreating a game with a game dynamic similar to *Flappy Bird game*.

## What is it ?
In this game, the player is a alien which has to avoid lasers by piloting his ship (when we click on the screen, the alien goes up and down after). For each laser we avoid, we have 1 point. We lose the game when our alien touches a pipe. Once we lose, our score is registered on a database with our pseudo and we can see the leaderboard.

## API
We created a simple API which has 2 roles: 
* Get (name and score of the player) data from the app and insert it or update the existing player in database
* Fetch all the players from database, order them by score and return a JSON file

We are able to get the name and a fake score of the player a  Top10 leaderboard from all the players who are in our database. The next step is creating the acutal game.


## Thank you ! :)
